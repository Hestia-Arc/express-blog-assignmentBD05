## Express Blog Project

A simple blog application built with Node.js, Express, and Pug. It allows users to view blog posts, and navigate to different categories.


### Setting Up the Project Locally

**Prerequisites:**

* **Node.js and npm:** To run a Node.js application, you'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

**Installation Steps:**

1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**
    * **Option 1: Download ZIP:** Visit the project repository on GitHub ([https://github.com/topics/express-blog](https://github.com/Hestia-Arc/express-blog-assignmentBD05)) and download the ZIP file.
    * **Option 2: Clone Repository:** If you're comfortable with Git, you can clone the repository using the following command in your terminal:

        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/Hestia-Arc/express-blog-assignmentBD05.git
        ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    * Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory (where you downloaded the ZIP or cloned the repository).
    * Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

        This command will download and install all the necessary libraries required for the project to function.

3. **Start the Server:**
    * Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

        This will start the server, and the application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

**Additional Notes:**

* This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of using a terminal or command prompt.
* If you encounter any issues during the installation process, refer to the project's documentation (if available) or search online for solutions related to specific errors.

Now that you have set up the project locally, you can explore the codebase or customize the application further based on your needs.
